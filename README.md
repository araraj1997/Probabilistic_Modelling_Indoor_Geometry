There is a need for enormous quantities of labelled data, performance increases in proportion to the amount of data used
Missing labels and mislabelled frames are very common in many real data sets
Introducing a synthetic data set would mean unlimited training data and improved semantic labelling
We aim to build a probabilistic framework for placing objects in a 2D scene
This could be used to generate large scale physically appropriate synthetic data sets for scene understanding
